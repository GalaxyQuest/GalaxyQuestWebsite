  <h3>As our heroes gathered, looking forward to their upcoming quest, they received a package from <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/#/">Galaxy Zoo HQ</a>.
    Their package included a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set">training data</a> and a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set">test data</a>.</h3><br>
      <ul>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Understanding your Inputs</h4>
          <ul><li>The training data with which we planned to train our ship's navigation system included thousands of input vectors, along with accompanying answer vectors. In our analysis of these images, we examined their dimensions (424x424), noticed that the galaxies were consistently centered in each image, and noticed that the images were in color.</ul></li>

        <li><h4 class="text-info">Understanding your Answers</h4>
          <ul><li>Our answer set was determined through <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/#/classify">crowd sourcing each galaxy's classification</a>. Since there were many people classifying each galaxy, our answer set contained a distribution of probabilities associated with each galaxy. Furthermore, each galaxy had many potential <a href="https://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/3175/media/Screen%20Shot%202013-09-25%20at%2010.08.17.png">attributes</a>. This meant the 'truth' that we were seeking was the collective responses of our citizens.</ul></li>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Understanding your Measurement</h4>
          <ul><li>Finally, Galaxy Zoo HQ had mentioned that our ship's performance would be judged by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/RootMeanSquaredError">Root Mean Squared Error Testing</a>. As this calculated result would be the only criteria for judgment, we were granted leeway in performance time and memory usage.</ul></li>

        <li><h4 class="text-info">Understanding your Inputs</h4>
          <ul><li>Turning a sharp eye toward your input data (the test and training sets) will be valuable in researching the best ways to approach your project. Expect a strong understanding of your input dataset to give you a few hypotheses on how to <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction">extract features</a> based on your specific input type. 
          Common input types include: categoric inputs (e.g., English word), ordinal inputs (e.g., age), and 2D arrays (e.g., an image). <a href=" http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs578/2003fa/performance_measures.pdf">This site</a> contains several common data inputs ranging from less to more complex.  </ul></li>

          <ul><li>Your output will be the foundation on which you build your machine. An understanding of your output will create relevant avenues for future research.</ul></li>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Understanding your Measurement</h4>
          <ul><li>Oftentimes accuracy determines the success of a machine learning algorithm. There are multiple types of accuracy tests, as outlined by <a href=" http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs578/2003fa/performance_measures.pdf">this article</a>.
          While accruacy is the most common measure, time and space efficiency may also play a part in assessing your machine. Be sure to pinpoint what your measures of success are prior to running tests.
