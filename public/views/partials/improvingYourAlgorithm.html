  <h3 class="pull-right">Here are some ways you can improve on your algorithm:</h3><br>

      <li><h4 class="text-info">Play with the algorithm parameters</h4>
        <ul><li>By changing the various parameters for your algorithm, you can come up with a baseline error to begin working with.  These will be specific to your type of algorithm.  In our case, we were able to change the max-depth of our trees, the number of trees we used, amount of features to use and the size of the subset of features each tree can choose from.</ul></li>
      </li>
      <li><h4 class="text-info">Test Driven Error Development</h4>
        <ul><li>Create or use a method to test where your algorithm is performing weakly.  By knowing where your error margins are greatest, you can develop new features to improve performance in these weak areas.</ul></li>
      <h4 class="text-info">Avoid overfitting or underfitting</h4>
      <h4 class="text-info">Consider looking into boosting.</h4>
      <li>While we did not use this in our algorithm, research suggests that it  can help improve performance.</li>
