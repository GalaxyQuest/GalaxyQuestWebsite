        <li><h4 class="text-info">Find out what other people have done already</h4>
          <ul><li>In order to create something new, our heroes knew that the first step would be to find out what already has been done.  With the internet being what it is today, it's easier than ever to have access to expert level material. Academic research, scholarly articles, and youtube lecture videos from universities and presentations became their starting point.  At this stage, we wanted to be learning a lot of "high-level" material to get a feel for the available resources that we could potentially use.  The crew members conducted presentations to the rest of the group in order to keep everybody up to speed on their findings.</ul></li>

        <li><h4 class="text-info">Narrow your focus</h4>
          <ul><li>Once we knew what information exists and the body of research supporting it consists of, it is time to narrow down the search.  The heroes start digging deeper into some ideas they glossed over in your first research sprint.  Given their problem and what the expected solution is supposed to provide, now is the time for them to start deciding on the method you they going to use.</ul></li>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Combine your machine and your data</h4>
          <ul><li>Now that our heroes have an algorithm, they start exploring how to use their data with it.  Finding out what tools exist to help them in their approach is critical. Some tools they are exploring come with built in features that may help them in their search for the answers they seek.</ul></li>

            <ul><li>While it took some time to set up our development environment, Sci-kit learn gave us a direction to start working in.  It is specifically built for our type of research and included a number of modules for us to use in our Galaxy Quest adventure.  There are also a lot of great videos and resources we found to aid educating ourselves about machine learning.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfNandoDF"> Professor Nando de Freitas</a> from the University of British Columbia has an excellent series of lecture videos to start learning with.  Thanks Professor de Freitas!</ul></li>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Narrow your focus</h4>
          <ul><li>After much research, we decided that we would use a Random Forest regression to solve our problem.  For more in-depth information and a kick ass visual on how Random Forests work, check out our <a href="/randomForestsVisual">visualization page.</a></ul></li>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Combine your machine and your data</h4>
            <ul><li>The tools we chose came with ways of developing features that we needed for our algorithm.  In particular, sci-kit image gave us a way to change the size of the images in our dataset and look for certain features within those images, then send them back to our algorithm to do work on.  Knowing your dataset and what features you may want to use, as well as what your particular algorithm is good at will help you in this step.</ul></li>
